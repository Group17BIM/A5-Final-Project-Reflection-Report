# A5-Final-Project-Reflection-Report

Reflections on your work and any future plans to continue the work you have or suggest for others:

Based on feedbback from last week groups we would like to invastigate connection of several beams that are inside each IFC model. We agree that voice in our video was too high squeaky thats becouse of edditing video using low quality tool and lack of time to correct it. We and peers that have seen our presentation are happy about the way results are presented and clearly described used case we have chosen. But area for future work is still open for new approvements. One of them could be visualisation of loaded structure with weak points in context of durability - our mechanical interest of this project.
