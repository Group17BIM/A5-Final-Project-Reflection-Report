# A5-Final-Project-Reflection-Report

Reflections on your work and any future plans to continue the work you have or suggest for others:

Based on feedback from last week groups we would like to investigate connection of several beams that are inside each IFC model. We agree that voice in our video was too high squeaky thatâ€™s because of editing video using low quality tool and lack of time to correct it. We and peers that have seen our presentation are happy about the way results are presented and clearly described used case we have chosen. But area for future work is still open for new improvements. One of them could be visualization of loaded structure with weak points in context of durability - our mechanical interest of this project. 

Future possibilities:
   - Standard exchanges can be smooth and seamless
   - It will be not difficult to compose a new IfcObject (not a new IfcEntity) and compose the Object to reflect a new object type
   - New exchange definition will be similar in difficulty to setting up a webpage, or forms-based Word document.
   - Many services will be provided by subscription on cloud servers (with reasonable security)
   - Cloud servers will become a major AEC technology.
   - Many BIM/VDC applications, for authoring design data, running analyses, scheduling, etc. will be cloud based
   - High level query systems for accessing desired objects are needed and will have two levels: classes desired, then instances
